# VKOSPI Multivariate Forecasting Project

This repository contains a complete multivariate time-series forecasting study for the VKOSPI Index, using both classical statistical models and modern deep learning / foundation models.
The project is structured into two Jupyter Notebook files, each representing a different modeling paradigm.
